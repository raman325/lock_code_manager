# Lock Code Manager

Home Assistant code manager integration for locks. This integration allows you to control the user codes for one (or more) locks. In addition to easily setting up new codes or replacing existing codes, the integration lets you define a schedule for when the code should be active or a maximum number of uses before the code no longer works.

For more information, please see the topic for this package at the [Home Assistant Community Forum]().
