# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Files to Exclude from Code Review

The following files should be excluded from GitHub Copilot code reviews as they are generated/built artifacts:

### Generated JavaScript Files

- `custom_components/lock_code_manager/www/lock-code-manager-strategy.js`
  - **Why:** This is a minified/bundled JavaScript file generated by Rollup from TypeScript source files in the `ts/` directory
  - **Source:** Built from `ts/main.ts` via `yarn build` (see `rollup.config.js`)
  - **Already marked:** This file is marked with `linguist-generated=true` in `.gitattributes`

### How to Ignore Files

1. **Using `.gitattributes`** (already configured):
   ```
   custom_components/lock_code_manager/www/lock-code-manager-strategy.js linguist-generated=true
   ```
   This marks the file as generated for GitHub's linguist, which should exclude it from diffs and code reviews.

2. **For Copilot Pull Request Reviewer:**
   - The `linguist-generated=true` attribute should automatically exclude files from review
   - This file explicitly documents the exclusion for clarity

### When to Review These Files

- **Never** review the generated `.js` file directly
- **Always** review the TypeScript source files in the `ts/` directory instead
- The generated file should only change as a result of `yarn build` after TypeScript changes

### Related Files to Review Instead

| Generated File | Review These Source Files Instead |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `custom_components/lock_code_manager/www/lock-code-manager-strategy.js` | Files in `ts/` directory, especially `ts/main.ts`, `ts/generate-view.ts`, `ts/types.ts` |

## Build Process

To regenerate the JavaScript bundle:
```bash
yarn build
```

To watch for changes during development:
```bash
yarn watch
```
