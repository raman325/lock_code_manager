Dev: - Track state updates to locks in event and sensor entities to update availability - Figure out how to handle builds and releases - Figure out how to add which keys and corresponding states caused the binary sensor state change in the logs - Instead of requiring the integration provider code to provide the device entry, leverage the entity and device registry - Reevaluate logging
Test: - Test enabling and disabling calendar/number of uses, adding and removing locks, etc. - Test allowing two different config entries to use the same lock if they don't use overlapping slots - Test invalid lock entity ID: 1. Test when there are multiple locks results in the lock being removed and a persistent notification automatically being created. 2. Test when there are no valid locks that a reauth config flow is started. - Test strategy
Docs: - Document how to use the strategy, including the additional custom card dependencies - Document strategy configuration options (include_code_slot_sensors)
