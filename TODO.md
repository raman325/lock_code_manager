## User-Facing Features

- **Config flow: lock reset in options flow** — Extend the lock reset step
  (clear/adopt unmanaged codes) to the options flow when new locks are added.
  Adopt should merge into existing slot config (preserve names, settings) rather
  than creating fresh entries. Key considerations: (1) compute "unmanaged" against
  the *new* slot config being submitted, not the current stored config, so removing
  a slot doesn't immediately offer to clear it; (2) existing managed slots on
  write-only locks (Matter) show as UNKNOWN — filter these out using the new config
  rather than offering to reset them; (3) if re-setting managed PINs for safety
  after lock reset, note this to the user.
- **Config flow: conflicting integration detection** — Warn if Keymaster or other
  code management integrations are detected at setup.
- **Clear all unmanaged codes** — Button or service to clear unmanaged code slots
  on a lock.
- **Bulk operations** — Enable/disable multiple slots at once.
- **Import/export slot configuration**
- **PIN validation** — Warn on simple PINs ("1234", "0000"), duplicate PINs
  across slots, format violations against lock requirements, and slot conflicts
  across config entries.
- **Service actions:**
  - `set_temporary_code` — time-limited PIN
  - `generate_pin` — auto-generate secure PIN
  - `bulk_enable` / `bulk_disable`
- **Custom Jinja templates** — Ship `.jinja` macros for LCM entity resolution
  (e.g. `lcm_slot_entities(config_entry_id, slot_num)`). Auto-install to
  `custom_templates/` during setup.
- **Drift detection alerting** — Alert users when drift detection consistently
  fails (e.g. lock offline). Currently only logged.

## Providers

**Current:** Akuvox, Matter, Schlage, Z-Wave JS, Virtual (testing)

**Open PRs:** ZHA (#739), MQTT/Zigbee2MQTT (#740)

**Future:** Nuki, SwitchBot, SmartThings

**Cannot support:** esphome (no API), august/yale/yalexs_ble/yale_smart_alarm
(library limitations)

## Architecture Considerations

- **Event-driven vs optimistic push updates** — For providers that support push
  events (Matter LockUserChange, Z-Wave value updates), consider removing
  optimistic pushes from set/clear methods and relying solely on events. The
  event is the lock's actual confirmation the credential was stored, while
  optimistic pushes only confirm the service call was accepted. Event-only
  updates give a single source of truth and simpler code, at the cost of a
  brief latency window before the coordinator updates. Z-Wave may still need
  optimistic pushes to avoid sync loops with stale cache reads.

- **Matter provider: direct Matter client commands** — Replace HA service calls
  (`matter.set_lock_credential`, etc.) with direct `MatterClient.send_device_command()`
  calls to get structured response objects (e.g., `SetCredentialResponse.status`
  with `DlStatus.kDuplicate`). Currently duplicate detection relies on string
  matching the error message. Direct commands would give typed status codes for
  duplicate, occupied, resource exhausted, etc.

## Code Quality

- **Dual storage pattern** — Simplify `data` + `options` config entry pattern.
  Document when to use each.
- **Coordinator-owned sync managers** — Move sync manager lifecycle from binary
  sensor entities to coordinator (survives entity recreation during config
  updates).
- **Dataclass conversion** — Convert config entry data and internal dicts to typed
  dataclasses with `from_dict`/`from_entry` class methods.
- **Websocket optimization** — Add optional `include_entities`/`include_locks`
  flags to `get_config_entry_data` command.
- **Entity registry change detection** — Warn if LCM entity IDs change (reload
  required).
- **Provider diagnostics** — Add `get_diagnostic_data()` to `BaseLock` for
  provider-specific diagnostic information.

## Frontend

- Unify slot and lock data card designs (prefer slot card pattern).
- Test visual editor for both cards.

## Process

- `CLAUDE.md` points to `AGENTS.md`; update `AGENTS.md` after architecture
  changes.
- Review TODOs after completing current work, when starting new features, during
  refactoring sessions, or on `/todos`.
